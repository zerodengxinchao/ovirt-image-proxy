ovirt-image-proxy
=================

The oVirt Image Proxy provides a proxy server allowing clients to
perform I/O with VM disk images and ISOs located within the oVirt
virtualization environment.


Installation
============

The image proxy can be installed on most hosts that have a working
Python 2 environment with the needed dependencies.  To install the
rpm package:

  sudo yum install ovirt-image-proxy
  engine-setup

This will install all necessary dependencies and launch the setup,
which is a module run by the oVirt engine setup program.  The prompts
during setup depend on other installed packages; if ovirt-engine is
on the host you may be prompted with additional questions.  On a
separate host, you will be prompted to enter the address of your
engine; this allows the image proxy to fetch the engine's public key
and register itself with the engine.

To install from source, install the dependencies listed in the rpm
spec file and then:

  make install

Afterward you will need to manually register the proxy with your
engine and edit $DESTDIR/etc/ovirt-image-proxy/config.ini to add
your engine's network address.


Development
===========

Patches are welcome!

During development you may want to build/install the proxy.  There are
a few ways to go about this:

  `ovirt-image-proxy [options]` - run the proxy in-place, with debug
   options and alternate paths to configuration files, if desired.

  `python setup.py install` - Build/install the lib files and main
   script, but not the service/log/etc files.

  `make install` - Build/install everything (with DESTDIR specified
   if packaging); this uses python-setuptools for some of the work.

  `rpmbuild [options]` - Build an rpm; this uses make for the building
   and installation.

When using an editor with code completion, it may be useful to have run
`make generated-files` to create any files with constants that depend
on the environment.

When submitting changes, please first make sure to apply the git commit
template (`git config commit.template commit-template.txt`).

Please send any patches to:

  gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-image-proxy


Packaging
